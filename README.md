# Parsee
Parsee is a web application for storing manga titles that you've read! The goal is to be able to locally host it so that users can record what they've read in their own database.
## What's the purpose of Parsee?
This project is created solely for the purpose of centralizing what people have read centrally. As users like me have probably read manga in different sites, which makes the reading history fragmented and inconsistent.

## Can I contribute?
Yes. Everybody who's interested in the project can contribute! PR naming scheme should look like this: add/feature
